# VentSpace - Hack4Humanity 2025

## Project Overview
VentSpace is a compassionate platform designed for Gen Z to anonymously vent their emotions, receive empathetic AI-powered support, and contribute to the environment by planting real trees for every vent submitted. We aim to merge mental wellness with environmental action to create a holistic impact on individuals and the planet.

## Features
- Anonymous vent submission categorized by emotional themes (stress, anxiety, loneliness)
- 24/7 AI-powered chatbot providing empathetic conversational support
- Mood tracking dashboard with sentiment analysis and growth metrics
- Real tree planting through NGO partnerships linked to user vents
- Privacy-first design ensuring no personally identifiable information is stored unless voluntarily provided

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next.js, React
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Database: MongoDB (NoSQL)
- AI: Pre-trained NLP models (Hugging Face Transformers)
- Deployment: Vercel (Frontend), AWS/Supabase (Backend + Database)

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository

4. Run backend server (`uvicorn main:app --reload`)  
5. Run frontend (`npm run dev`)  
6. Access `http://localhost:3000` to use the app

## Future Roadmap
